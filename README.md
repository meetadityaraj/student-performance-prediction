# AI-Driven Student Performance Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Driven Student Performance Prediction System is a Machine Learning project that predicts a student's expected final marks based on academic factors.

The system uses student information such as attendance, study hours, previous examination marks, assignment marks, and internal assessment marks to predict final performance.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict expected student final marks.
* Analyze important academic factors.
* Classify student performance.
* Provide a simple web interface for prediction.
* Help identify students who may need academic improvement.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

The project uses **Linear Regression** to predict final marks.
